# Current Ideas
1. It's gonna be a roguelike, text-based, turn-based adventure game
2. At the start of the game, you choose 1 of 3 characters
  - A gunslinger  (ranged, sneaky gunfighter)
  - A swordmaster (fast, tough, melee fighter)
  - A neuromancer (hacker/caster-type, manipulates implants, station defenses)
3. Most of the game is going to take place on a space station.
4. At some point youre going to have either a spaceship, or a mecha, depending on which protagonist you choose. Probably.
5. Going to keep the combat/equipment/min-maxing as simple as possible. I want this to be about the journey and testing the player's decision making and situational awareness.
6. Knowing me, the final level is going to be on some crazy balls-to-the-wall shit with enemies everywhere fighting each other and you.
7. I'm thinking i'll do this with either C++ or Rust. It'd be a fun learning experience.
8. If I like how it turns out, may try to port it to iOS/Swift and see if i can't make a buck or two. 
9. I guess I should come up with a story. God willing the player learns SOMETHING about themselves during the experience.
10.Theres going to be a final 4th route that brings the stories together
